# First Principles Analysis

## What This Application Is
A profitability dashboard for dairy industry account managers that:
1. Syncs time data from Harvest
2. Syncs CRM data from HubSpot
3. Calculates profitability metrics
4. Shows dashboards and exceptions
5. Exports reports

## Current State (Verified)

### ‚úÖ What Works
- Local server runs on http://localhost:3000
- Frontend loads (title: "AM Copilot - MoA Account Manager AI")
- API structure exists at /api/*
- Auth middleware is in place (session-based)

### ‚ùå What's Broken
- Authentication configuration missing (needs AUTH_USERNAME, AUTH_PASSWORD, SESSION_SECRET)
- Middleware was blocking login endpoint (FIXED)
- Production shows 404

### ü§î What's Unknown
- Whether the data sync actually works
- If profitability calculations are correct
- Why production is 404 when local works

## Minimal Requirements to Function

### 1. Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Authentication (minimum)
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=<secure-password>
SESSION_SECRET=<random-32-char-string>

# Data Sources (minimum)
HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=<from-harvest>
HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID=<from-harvest>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

### 2. Critical Paths
1. **Login**: `/api/auth/login` ‚Üí Creates session
2. **Data Sync**: `/api/sync/harvest` ‚Üí Gets time entries
3. **Dashboard**: `/` ‚Üí Shows profitability data

## From First Principles: What Should We Do?

### Step 1: Make Authentication Work
- Need to set AUTH_USERNAME, AUTH_PASSWORD, SESSION_SECRET in .env.local
- Login endpoint now accessible (middleware fixed)

### Step 2: Verify Data Flow
- Can we connect to Harvest?
- Can we store data in PostgreSQL?
- Can we calculate profitability?

### Step 3: Fix Only What's Actually Broken
- Don't assume architectural problems
- Don't rewrite working code
- Test each fix in isolation

## The Real Architecture (Discovered)

Based on code inspection:
- **Next.js API Routes**: Handle web requests (/api/*)
- **Express Server**: Exists but may not be needed
- **Authentication**: Session-based with signed cookies
- **Data Flow**: Harvest ‚Üí PostgreSQL ‚Üí Dashboard

## Why Production Might Be 404

Possibilities:
1. Vercel deployment missing environment variables
2. Build failing silently
3. Routes not properly configured for Vercel
4. Database connection failing

## Next Actions (Minimal, Tested)

1. **Set up minimal auth locally**
   ```bash
   echo "AUTH_USERNAME=admin" >> .env.local
   echo "AUTH_PASSWORD=test123" >> .env.local
   echo "SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env.local
   ```

2. **Test login flow**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"test123"}'
   ```

3. **If that works, test data endpoints**
   - With session cookie from login
   - Check what actually returns data

4. **Only then consider architectural changes**

## Lessons Applied

- ‚úÖ Started by understanding purpose
- ‚úÖ Verified what actually works
- ‚úÖ Found and fixed specific bug (middleware)
- ‚úÖ Not assuming everything is broken
- ‚úÖ Testing incrementally

## What I Won't Do (Yet)

- Unify APIs (might be intentional separation)
- "Fix" memory leaks (might not exist in serverless)
- Rewrite auth (current system might work fine)
- Judge architecture (without understanding constraints)
