# The Resurrection Plan - We Go Again

## Mission Statement
**We're not abandoning this. We're fixing it properly, milestone by milestone.**

---

## 🎯 Milestone 0: Get CI Green (Day 1 - TODAY)
**Target: Make the build pass**

### Tasks:
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors ✅ (Already done)
- [ ] Fix failing tests (4 failures)
- [ ] Clear webpack cache corruption
- [ ] Fix build command issue
- [ ] Get CI pipeline green

### Commands:
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

### Success Criteria:
- CI workflow passes completely
- All commands run without errors

---

## 🏗️ Milestone 1: Architecture Convergence (Week 1)
**Target: Single API surface**

### Decision: Express API Wins
Why: Already has auth, business logic, and database operations

### Tasks:
- [ ] Migrate Next.js API routes to Express
  - [ ] /api/harvest/* → Express
  - [ ] /api/hubspot/* → Express
- [ ] Remove app/api directory entirely
- [ ] Update frontend to use Express endpoints only
- [ ] Single auth middleware everywhere

### Success Criteria:
- One /api entry point
- All routes protected by same auth
- Frontend works with new endpoints

---

## 💪 Milestone 2: Platform Hardening (Week 2)
**Target: Production-ready infrastructure**

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement bounded cache with LRU eviction
  ```typescript
  class BoundedCache<T> {
    private maxSize = 10000;
    private ttl = 3600000; // 1 hour
    // LRU implementation
  }
  ```
- [ ] Fix profitability SQL with proper parameterization
- [ ] Add real JWT session management
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### Success Criteria:
- Memory stays stable under load
- SQL queries parameterized correctly
- Real sessions, not env tokens
- External API failures handled gracefully

---

## 🔌 Milestone 3: Frontend Integration (Week 3)
**Target: Real data, real auth**

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement login flow with JWT
- [ ] Add auth context to React app
- [ ] Wire all components to real API
- [ ] Remove ALL mock data files
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations

### Success Criteria:
- User can login and see their data
- No mock data anywhere
- Errors handled gracefully
- Loading states everywhere

---

## 🛡️ Milestone 4: Safety Net (Week 4)
**Target: Never break again**

### Tasks:
- [ ] 80% test coverage minimum
- [ ] E2E tests for critical paths
- [ ] Performance tests (1000+ records)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] CI/CD enforcement

### Success Criteria:
- Tests catch regressions
- Performance metrics tracked
- Alerts fire before users notice
- New developers can onboard

---

## 🚀 Milestone 5: Launch (Week 5)
**Target: Production deployment**

### Tasks:
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Migration plan
- [ ] Rollback plan
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Success Criteria:
- Handles production load
- No security vulnerabilities
- Can rollback if needed
- Users successfully migrated

---

## 📊 Kill Switches (Non-Negotiable)

### Immediate Stops:
- CI red for 3 consecutive days → STOP
- Memory leak detected → STOP
- Security vulnerability found → STOP

### Review Triggers:
- Milestone delayed by 1 week → Review scope
- New architectural flaw found → Review approach
- Team velocity < 50% planned → Review resources

---

## 🎮 Daily Routine

### Every Morning:
1. Check CI status
2. Review yesterday's progress
3. Pick today's tasks
4. Update todo list

### Every Evening:
1. Commit working code
2. Update progress tracker
3. Note blockers
4. Plan tomorrow

---

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. CI Is God
- Nothing merges with red CI
- Fix breaks immediately
- Tests before features

### 2. One Thing at a Time
- Single API first
- Then platform
- Then frontend
- Then safety

### 3. Progress Over Perfection
- Working > Perfect
- Ship increments
- Refactor later

### 4. Communication
- Daily updates
- Weekly demos
- Blockers raised immediately
